NetCDF-CF Geometry and Timeseries Tools for R
===
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/USGS-R/ncdfgeom.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/USGS-R/ncdfgeom) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/USGS-R/ncdfgeom/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/USGS-R/ncdfgeom?branch=master)

`ncdfgeom` reads and writes geometry data (points lines and polygons), attributes of geometries, and time series associated with the geometries in a standards-compliant way.

It implements the NetCDF-CF Spatial Geometries specification and the timeSeries feature type of the [Discrete Sampling Geometry](http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#discrete-sampling-geometries) NetCDF-CF specification.
