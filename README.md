`ncdfgeom` reads and writes geometry data (points lines and polygons), attributes of geometries, and time series associated with the geometries in a standards-compliant way.

It implements the NetCDF-CF Spatial Geometries specification and the timeSeries feature type of the [Discrete Sampling Geometry](http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#discrete-sampling-geometries) NetCDF-CF specification.
