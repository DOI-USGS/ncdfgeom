\title{Put geometry data in a NetCDF-CF File}
\usage{
addGeomData(nc_file, geomData, instance_dim_name, variables = c())
}
\arguments{
\item{nc_file}{A string file path to the nc file to be created. It must already have
an instance dimension.}

\item{geomData}{An object of class \code{SpatialLines} or \code{SpatialPolygons} with
WGS84 lon in the x coordinate and lat in the y coordinate.
Note that three dimensional geometries is not supported.}

\item{instance_dim_name}{A string to name the instance dimension.  Defaults to "instance"}

\item{variables}{A character vector of variable names that the geometry data
container variable name will be added to.}
}
\description{
Creates a file with point, line or polygon instance data ready for the extended NetCDF-CF timeSeries featuretype format.
Will also add attributes if a sp dataframe object is passed in.
